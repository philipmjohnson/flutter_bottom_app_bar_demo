# Flutter_Bottom_App_Bar_Demo

This is a code sample from the [BottomAppBar](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/BottomAppBar-class.html) class documentation.

The code illustrates the following useful things (for me):

* Local state to change the display of the UI.
* [SwitchListTile] and [RadioListTile]
* [FloatingActionButton]
* [IconTheme], [IconThemeData], and [IconButton]
